open points /notes

for players number in in controllers/home there is no coresponding number for challenges and or lobby line 38

some data for the ranking section and general stats are missing

the stats table has completly changed i just displayed the stats that are in there now if we want to display ffa points and so on its maybe faster to just take that into stats rather then tripple joining tables

Not sure about the tournament table if it stayed the same or not
