Open Points and Notes

We cant get the "players online in" for a few modes because i dont know the corresponding number for it Controllers/Home line 38

Data for the Ranking pages (challenges and stats mainly) has either changed or is no not there/got deleted or has not been added How do we continue there?

The only major point left is the tournaments page



Possible problem could be the signup again
