Open Points and Notes

The only major point left is the tournaments page (started but nothing solid waiting for now until the database for it is setup)
commented out the link that links to the tournament page in templates/header

Possible problem could be the signup again

BUGS:

Players online shows the players without ";" 

The ranking for the survior challange is in the wrong order
